The Survey of Consumer Finances (SCF) is normally a triennial cross-sectional survey of U.S. families. The survey data include information on familiesâ€™ balance sheets, pensions, income, and demographic characteristics. Information is also included from related surveys of pension providers and the earlier such surveys conducted by the Federal Reserve Board. No other study for the country collects comparable information. Data from the SCF are widely used, from analysis at the Federal Reserve and other branches of government to scholarly work at the major economic research centres.

In this project, we are going to work with data from the Survey of Consumer Finances (SCF). The SCF is a survey sponsored by the US Federal Reserve. It tracks financial, demographic and opinion information about families in the United States. The survey is conducted every three years and we will work with an extract of the results from 2019.
